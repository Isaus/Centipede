Game Design Centrip√®te Goal: Have the better score possible.

Elements: The game consists of a player in the screen, enemies who appear, of walls which appear as well as of a total score

Rules: The game begins while the player begins his first movement. The player can move at the bottom of the screen towards the left or the right. The player little shot by missiles on a rectilinear trajectory. An enemy starts in the corner top-left of the screen and moves in the horizontal. When the enemy bangs against a wall he comes down from a line and changes direction (left / right). If an enemy is banged by a missile, he creates a wall and divides in two from the point of impact. If a missile touches four times a same wall that vanishes. If an enemy touches the player or takes out of the screen the player loses the party.
